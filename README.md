# Aspirations

I started this simple project as a first little project to learn [Janet](https://janet-lang.org). 

I use a set of what I've termed "aspirations" that I repeat to myself while exercising and at other times to focus my mind and remind me of who I am and how I want to live my life. I've been doing this for four months now (as of December 2024) and I have 15 such statements so far, and I write new ones each month. I primarily focus on the new aspirations for each month, but every few days I review statements from past months to keep them fresh. The purpose of the project is two fold:

* Generate a random list of statements to review on my review days.
* I recently purchased the [TRMNL device](https://usetrmnl.com) and I want to write a custom plugin to show a random aspiration on it. This code will push a new statement to the server to be displayed via a webhook.
